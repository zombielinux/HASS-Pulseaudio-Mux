The goal of this project is to create a new card for HASS that will allow for population of multiple pulseaudio sinks/sources from different hosts such that they can be selected and interlocked to play out of one or more speakers on different pulseaudio sinks. 

This is a one to none, one to one, one to many, or one to all home audio distribution setup.
